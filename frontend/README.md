# flow-atelier

A web UI for building, scheduling, and running conduit workflows — DAG-based pipelines that orchestrate bash commands, AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor), nested conduits, and human-in-the-loop approval gates.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — browse conduits, view run history, and manage scheduled jobs
- **Designer** — visual DAG editor for authoring conduit workflows with drag-and-drop node placement and dependency edges
- **Kanban** — task board for tracking conduit runs across columns (todo → in progress → done) with live log streaming and HITL prompts

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** — dev server and bundler
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first styling
- **Zustand** — state management
- **XYFlow** — canvas/DAG rendering in the designer
- **dnd-kit** — drag-and-drop in the kanban board
- **Radix UI** — accessible primitives (dialogs, selects, tooltips, etc.)
- **Vitest** — unit tests (jsdom environment)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** (or your preferred package manager)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

A `.env` file in the project root (gitignored) is optional — the app runs with the defaults below, which mirror `.env.example`. Set a variable in `.env` to override it:

| Variable             | Description                              | Default                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `VITE_USE_MOCK_API`  | `"true"` for simulated backend data      | `false` (real backend)   |
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL`   | Base URL for the backend API             | serving origin (same as the UI) |
| `VITE_API_TOKEN`     | Bearer token sent to the backend         | empty (no auth header)   |

When the UI is served by `atelier serve` (the bundled SPA), `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
defaults to the page's own origin, so the frontend automatically targets
whatever host:port the server runs on — no URL to keep in sync. Set it only when
the UI runs on a separate origin (e.g. the Vite dev server on `:5173`).

`VITE_API_TOKEN` has no default on purpose: a shipped token would be a
published shared credential. Leave it empty for local use (`atelier serve` runs
unauthenticated by default) and set it only when the backend is started with a
matching `ATELIER_API_TOKEN`.

To develop the UI against a backend on another port:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

To develop against fixture data with no backend running at all:

```
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

### Sync build to the backend

The production build has to land in `flow_atelier/dist/` so the FastAPI app can
serve it (see `flow_atelier/services/api/app.py`). The `Frontend` CI workflow
does this automatically on every pull request and commits the result, so you
normally don't need to. To do it by hand from the repo root:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..
rm -rf flow_atelier/dist
cp -r frontend/dist flow_atelier/dist
```

### Preview the production build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Scripts

| Command              | Description                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`        | Start dev server (port 5173)       |
| `npm run build`      | Type-check and build for production|
| `npm run preview`    | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run test`       | Run unit tests once                |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run unit tests in watch mode       |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage report  |

## How It Works

The app has two operating modes controlled by `VITE_USE_MOCK_API`:

- **Mock mode** — simulates the backend with fixture data and deterministic timing. Conduits run through their tasks with realistic delays and canned log output. No backend required.
- **Real mode** — connects to a flow-atelier backend via REST API. Tasks are submitted and tracked server-side with real execution logs streamed back.

The **runner engine** (`src/runner/`) drives task execution in both modes: it walks the conduit's DAG of tasks, handles human-in-the-loop gates (pausing for user input), streams log lines into the kanban cards, and moves tasks through columns as they progress.
