 * The one description of every tool. There used to be four copies of this
 * (designer TaskNode, designer ToolPanel, designer Inspector, kanban toolMeta)
 * and they had drifted: `harness:claude-code` rendered purple in a canvas node
 * and terracotta in the palette beside it, `harness:codex` was near-white in
 * two files and pink in the other two, and `tool:hitl` was missing entirely
 * from one of them.
 *
 * Colours are token references, not literals, so each one resolves to a
 * lightness that clears 4.5:1 against whichever theme is active — the old
 * literals were tuned for the dark surface and measured 1.1-2.2:1 on light.
