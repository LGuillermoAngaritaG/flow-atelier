"""Regression tests for install.sh.

The real script is executed, but never against the network and never against
the invoking user's home directory: ``curl`` is replaced by a stub on ``PATH``
that serves a synthetic release from disk, and ``HOME`` points at a tmp dir.
Nothing here downloads software or writes to the caller's shell config.

Covers the two fixes that shipped with this branch:

- shell detection keys off the login shell (``$SHELL``), not the interpreter,
  so ``curl … | bash`` on macOS no longer writes to a ``~/.bashrc`` that zsh
  never reads;
- SHA-256 verification falls back across ``sha256sum`` / ``shasum`` /
  ``openssl`` rather than being skipped on the platform missing one.
