"""Harness executors — five ACP-speaking coding agents.

Each harness is a thin :class:`AcpHarnessExecutor` subclass differing only
in its ``launch_cmd``. Each reuses the host CLI's own config and auth.

- ``harness:claude-code`` → ``@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`` via ``npx``
- ``harness:codex``       → ``@zed-industries/codex-acp`` via ``npx``
- ``harness:opencode``    → ``opencode acp`` (native ACP)
- ``harness:copilot``     → ``copilot --acp`` (GitHub Copilot CLI, native ACP)
- ``harness:cursor``      → ``@blowmage/cursor-agent-acp`` via ``npx``

Non-interactive mode sends one prompt turn and returns whatever the agent
streams before ``stop_reason``. Interactive mode keeps the session open
and loops: after each turn, if the accumulated output has not contained
the done marker, the executor asks the :class:`PromptSink` for the user's
next message and sends another ``session/prompt``. The loop terminates
when the marker appears or when :attr:`MAX_INTERACTIVE_TURNS` is reached.
