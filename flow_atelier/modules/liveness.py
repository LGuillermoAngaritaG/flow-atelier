"""Derive a ``crashed`` display sense for flows whose runner process died.

A flow that is hard-killed (SIGKILL, OOM, reboot, lid-close) never runs the
engine's failure handler, so its ``progress.json`` stays frozen at
``status: running`` forever. These helpers reclassify such a flow as
``crashed`` for display only — never mutating the persisted status — and only
when the runner is *provably* dead on this same host. Every uncertain case
(foreign host, missing pid, live pid, permission error) stays ``running``, so a
genuinely-live or remote flow is never false-accused.
