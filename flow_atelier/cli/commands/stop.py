"""`atelier stop` command.

Gracefully halt a healthy, locally-running flow by signalling its runner
process, instead of hunting for a PID and ``kill``-ing it by hand. The command
is conservative: it refuses (and does nothing) for any flow that already
finished, whose runner died, that runs on another host, or that shares its
runner process with other flows. SIGTERM is coarse — it signals the whole
process — so it is only sent when that process is known to own exactly one
running flow.

Note on PID recycling: between a flow starting and this command running the OS
could reuse ``runner_pid`` for an unrelated process. The host + alive + running
checks shrink that window but cannot fully close it.
